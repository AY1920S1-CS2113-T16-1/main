== Use Cases


* *Edit Command*: ( only in multi-step commands yet)
** *System*: Le Duc
** *Actor*: High school student
** *Use Case*: Modify task
*** User will type “edit”
*** Le Duc will list the entire task list
*** User type the index of the task
*** Le Duc asks which part will be modified if it is not a Todo task
*** User answer and modify

* *Shortcut*:
** *System*: Le Duc
** *Actor*: High school student
** *Use Case*: Create shortcut
*** User type “shortcut”
*** Le Duc will show the first command to be modified
*** User type the shortcut for that command
*** Le Duc will show the second command to be modified
*** User type the shortcut for that command
*** ...
*** Le Duc will show the k command to be modified
*** User type the shortcut for that command
*** Le Duc prompt an error, because there is a conflict between two shortcuts, and will ask to enter a new shortcut
*** User type another shortcut for that command
*** ...
*** Le Duc shows all the shortcuts

== Non-functional requirements

* *Task list size requirement*: The user is a super busy students, so he will have a lot of task. Size of task list possibly infinite (use of Arraylist, depends on the computer and the storage doesn’t use much as it is a written file).
* *Quality requirement*: The system is easy to understand and to be handled by a new user.
* *Mastery requirement*: The system is easy to be mastered, the typing of new task should be easy and fast.
* *Disaster recovery requirement*: If the system crash, the user shall find all his tasks in the storage file.

== Glossary

* *Fuzzy matching*: When searching for task descriptions via keyword, the "Sorensen-Dice" Fuzzy Matching algorithm is used to return top matches. This ensures that typos in the user query does not affect search performance
* *Recurrent task*: A task that repeat every day/week/month…

== Implementation

=== Shortcut


The shortcut mechanism is done by the ShortcutCommand. As every other command, it extends Command with a HashSet containing all the command’s shortcut name and another HashSet containing all the default command’s shortcut name. Others commands include now a static attribute named shortcut that correspond to the command’s shortcut. It implements these following methods:

* `ShortcutCommand#setOneShortcut` — set the shortcut of one command
* `ShortcutCommand#initializedSetShortcut` — initialized the HashSet contains all the default command’s shortcut name

There are three cases:

* one shot one command: The user write the command for the shortcut in one line
* multi step one command: The user write which command he wants to add a shortcut to, then the console ask what is the shortcut, and the user write the name of the shortcut
* multi step every command: The user asks the console that he wants to modify all the command, and the console will show one by one every command, and the user will modify one by one each command.

When the user launches the application, the program will read the config file, then set all shortcuts to previous shortcuts that the user has decided. If the user has not decided to customized shortcuts, it will be the default shortcut.

These following diagram show how the 3 cases were implemented:

==== One shot one command

The user type the "entry" (not shown in the sequence diagram) as `shortcut CommandName ShortcutName`.

The method setShortcut is static, thus an object Command won’t be created

==== Multi-step one command

The user type the "entry" (not shown in the sequence diagram) as `shortcut CommandName`. Then the console will ask what will be the new name for the shortcut.

==== Multi-step every command

The user type the "entry" (not shown in the sequence diagram) as `shortcut`. The console will display one command's name, then the console will ask what will be the new name for the shortcut. The console will repeat until every command have a shortcut.

==== Consideration

* The config file that contains all the name for the shortcut can be edit by hand, because it is faster to edit the config file than doing it via the application.
* When a command's shortcut is set, the default shortcut can still be used

=== Modify a Task

* *Reschedule an event task*

* *Edit a task* ( Only in multi-step commands yet)
