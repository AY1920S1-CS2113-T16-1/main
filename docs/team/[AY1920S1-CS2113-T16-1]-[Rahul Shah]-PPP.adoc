== Product Name: Le Duc

---
== Overview
Le Duc is a schedule management software aiming to assist high school students manage their academic and extracurricular tasks, with the goal of increasing their time management/productivity. User-Software interaction occurs on the command line, from which they have access to a variety of commands/operations.

== Contributions Summary
* *Major Enhancement*: *Added the ability to generate a reminder for upcoming tasks*
** What it does: Analyzes the user's tasklist, and will generate a reminder that highlights the top 3 upcoming tasks that are not yet complete.
** Justification: A user with a busy schedule could easily forget about a task that he/she must do. This feature will scan for upcoming tasks and remind the user of them, thus preventing the user from falling behind.

* *Major Enhancement*: *Created an Advanced Search Feature*
** What it does: Uses an advanced character matching algorithm to search for tasks by descriptions, despite partial queries or query typos. The feature also includes many other commands that allow the user to search for tasks by other metrics, such as completion, a date window, etc.
** Justification : The user may accidentally make a typo in their query, or make broad queries (search for tasks with only partial words). An advanced search feature allows for relevant results to be displayed despite imperfect queries.
** Contributions: Search by day/week/month was implemented by Jérôme Huang
* *Major Enhancement*: *Generate Statistics from the Tasklist*
** What it does: Will analyze the tasklist and display interesting metrics to the user, such as % of tasks completed, the count of each type of task, etc. User can view up to 23 detailed metrics, grouped by flags. There is one group of general statistics, one group of priority statistics, and one group of completion statistics.
** Justification: This feature will help the user to make future decisions. For example, in a case where a large percentage of tasks are not complete, he/she might refrain from taking on an additional workload. If the user has a large number of high priority tasks, the user could make the choice to finish those first, instead of completing tasks in chronological order. This is a rather unintuitive scheduling optimization that can be made if the user was presented with these priority statistics.
** Highlights: This enhancement will allow for interesting insights to be generated from the users schedule, most of which are not necessarily intuitive to see without aggregating all historical tasks over time.

* *Major Enhancement*: *Set a Customized Welcome Message for Le Duc*
** What it does: User can customize the message that gets displayed upon Le Duc startup. An internal refactoring of the UI class now allows for certain UI elements to be saved in a data file instead of being hard-coded, to allow for increased flexibility.
** Justification: The user may want to customize his/her software to distinguish it from that of other Le Duc users.

* *Major Enhancement*: *Major Refactoring for New Task Types*
** What it does: Modified most of the software to allow compatibility with the Homework task type. Please note (for RepoSense purposes) that this required line by line changes in almost every file that cannot be tagged in blocks. All former mentions of the Duke "Deadline" task was converted for the new "Homework" task type.
** Justification: Le Duc is targeting High School students, thus a Homework task type is necessary for our users.


* *Minor enhancement*: Code refactoring: offloaded helper methods to higher layers to increase cohesion between the Command and Ui classes.

== Contributions to the User Guide
Overview: I added user descriptions for my implemented features, and did general formatting/grammar adjustments document wide. Our User Guide is https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1/main/blob/master/docs/%5BAY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1%5D-Le%20Duc-UG.pdf[here]

=== Search for a task by relevancy : `find`

To find a task by character relevancy : `find QUERY`

The find command allows the user to search for tasks via character matching (NOT keyword matching).
The command will return the top 5 tasks ordered by ascending relevancy.

Typos in the user query will not affect performance.

Examples:

*Partial word query*

```
find scie
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Here are the most relevant tasks in your list:
         7. [H][V] science by: 05/05/2005 05:05 [Priority: 2]

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
*Typo in Query*

```
find homewqeuktest
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Here are the most relevant tasks in your list:
         6. [H][V] homeworktest by: 04/04/2004 04:04 [Priority: 5]

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
*If all tasks have <50% matching characters with the query*
```find zx
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         There is no matching tasks in your list
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
=== Customize the welcome message : `setwelcome`

To customize the welcome message: `setwelcome WELCOME`

Example:

* Original welcome message:
```
____        _
|  _ \ _   _| | _____
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Hello I'm Duke
        What can I do for you ?

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```


* setwelcome `hello World`
```
setwelcome Hello World
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         The welcome message is edited: Hello World
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
* New welcome message:
```
 ____        _
|  _ \ _   _| | _____
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Hello World

        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


```

Be careful:

*Reverting to the previous welcome message is not possible once a new message is set.
*Ensure the folder "data" is in the correct location. The welcome message is stored in this folder.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Overview: I have added the implementations of my features to the Developer Guide : remind, statistics, and find. Our Developer Guide is https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1/main/blob/master/docs/%5BAY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1%5D-Le%20Duc-DG.pdf[here].

* *Implementation for remind:*

Display the 3 most upcoming unfinished tasks : `remind`

Tasks with associated timestamps are prioritized.
Non-timestamp tasks are pushed to the back of the filtered and chronologically sorted tasklist. Completed tasks are not displayed.

Helper Methods:

* `filterTasks` - Extracts the Homework and Event tasks into a seperate ArrayList
* `sort` - Orders the filtered TaskList in chronological order.

* *Sequence Diagram of the Remind Feature:*

image::RemindSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

There are 3 cases:

* TaskList contains a mix of all objects
* TaskList contains only Todo objects
* TaskList contains no objects

==== TaskList contains only homework/Event objects

* The original TaskList is passed through a filter.
* The filtered TaskList is equal to the original TaskList, as there are no Todo objects to filter out. The filtered TaskList will then be sorted by TakList.sort(). The method will call each tasks .getDate() and build a sorted ArrayList. All Todo's will be appended to the end of the sortedlist
* The first 3 most upcoming tasks will be displayed to the user.
* *Output:*

```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [H][X] d1 by: 14/09/2019 22:33 [Priority: 5]
2. [E][X] e1 at: 21/09/2019 00:00 - 28/10/2019 22:22 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][X] td1 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList only contains Todo Objects

* The TaskList.sort() method will return the original list containing only Todo's. Todo tasks have no associated date, so the order in which they were created will be preserved. This is assuming that the order they were created by the user is the order of the intended completion.
* *Output:*
```---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
remind
1. [T][X] todo1 [Priority: 5]
2. [T][X] todo2 [Priority: 5]
3. [T][X] todo3 [Priority: 5]
```
==== TaskList Contains No Objects

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are no upcoming tasks in your list
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

==== Consideration
* Sorting the TaskList in place was considered, but it reduced cohesion of the design.
* It was considered to only remind the user of tasks that are coming up in the next week,
but that would limit its potential utility
